            In September 1965, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
            Prabhupada embarked on a journey from India, driven by the prophesy
            made five hundred years ago by <b>Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu</b> that
            his name would be chanted in every town and village of the world.
            Amidst the spiritual desert of Kali-Yuga, the centers of Krishna
            Consciousness serve as oases of shelter, one such being the Shri
            Shri Krishna Balaram Mandir.

            <p>
              Srila Prabhupada envisioned spreading the worship of Sri Sri Radha
              Govindaji to the whole world, expressing his desire to establish a
              beautiful Krishna Balarama Temple in Jaipur. In a letter, he
              wrote,{" "}
              <b className="text-[#d17a29] block pt-1">
                &quot;So I want to open a duplicate Krishna Balarama temple in
                Jaipur. I am sending separately copies of pictures of our
                Krishna Balarama Temple in Vrindaban. Of course there is also
                Radha Krishna and Gaura Nitai. I wish that you have some land in
                Jaipur and help us in constructing a temple like in Vrindaban.
                &quot;

              In 1991, ISKCON Jaipur began its journey, inspired by Srila
              Prabhupada&apos;s vision. Then, in 2019, the grand opening of the
              temple was held, <b>fulfilling Srila Prabhupada&apos;s desire</b>{" "}
              for a Krishna Balarama Mandir in Jaipur. Today, ISKCON Jaipur
              stands as a testament to his devotion and serves as a beacon of
              spiritual enlightenment for all.
