                  Master Artist Mr. Colin Greenwood, inspired by his encounter
                  with His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada in 1972, has taken
                  residence at the Sri Sri Giridhari Dauji Mandir to fulfill his
                  dream of creating exceptional stained glass artistry. He is
                  setting up his studio and arranging specialized materials to
                  bring this vision to life. This project not only aims to
